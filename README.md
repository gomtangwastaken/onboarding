# **Welcome to GomTang!**
   
**GomTang** means Korean beef bone soup. I just chose it because I like the soup.   
   
Projects are more fun done together. This is a place for anyone who wants to create and collaborate on personal projects.   
   
How I envision the group to operate:   
1. someone has a project idea
2. they do some initial groundwork figuring out the direction of the project, requirements, etc.
3. inform group members, connect with interested members
4. create a project here with some initial stories
5. work on the project
6. document the finished process! (This way we can show off our work and let others use it.) Here's an [example](https://github.com/jasondeglint/MaViS).
   
# Have an idea? Here's how to create a new project
- create a new project in the [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/gomtangwastaken/projects?type=beta) tab as well as a repository.
- add some context so others can understand what you are trying to work on.
- gain interest by letting people know and discussing with people!
- create several stories on a Kanban board so others can collaborate on your project.
   
# Collaborate on someone else's project by looking at the [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/gomtangwastaken/projects?type=beta) tab.
- ask them if you can join, and what you can work on. Usually best to have a chat to define expectations and goals.
- pick up stories in the kanban board.

# Coding best practices
- practice [test-driven-development](https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html)
- branches:
   - main: master repo, contains the latest versioned code
   - versions: r{X}.{X} each time you release a new version, keep track of it
- development workflow:
   - fork repo, create a branch for a feature you're working on.
   - after you're done, create a PR to the main repo (get at least 1 peep to take a look) and merge it in once it's ready.
   - every release, tag the commit in master with a version.
