A project ideas board
Collaboration rules
Characters I want to embody in this name: K E F L G M I

Moa: gather Ato: Gift

Kinetic energy: moving constantly Relentless

Fun: Have fun Learning/growth Meaningful: work on something you find meaningful Impactful

Something everyone can put on their resumes Learning Meaningful Impactful Fun

In a sense, an collaborative incubator
